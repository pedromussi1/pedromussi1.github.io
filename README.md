### VolumeCV
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/pedromussi1/MyMovieList
  * **Description:** The goal of this project was to develop a program that used AI how recognize human hands through feedback of a webcamera and use that to control audio volume of the computer. This worked by identifying points in the hand for discerning between different fingers, and using that information to change the volume of the computer as we judged best.
  * **Tools:**  Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, PyCharm

### FingerCounter
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/pedromussi1/MyMovieList
  * **Description:** The goal of this project was to create a web application
    similar to MyAnimeList or Letterboxd, where user can have a profile filled
    with movie titles and their ratings for each title. I used datasets from
    Kaggle to populate a table in my database and used this database of
    available movies for the user to choose from and add to their respective list.
  * **Tools:**  PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js, Kaggle, Visual Studio Code

### JWT with PERN
  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/pedromussi1/JWT
  * **Description:** This website was created to showcase my skills as a PERN developer along with using JSON Web Tokens
    to provide authentication and authorization for user logins. JWT was used to secure web APIs. When a user logs in,
    the server verifies the user's credentials. If they are valid, the server generates a JWT containing a set of claims
    and signs it using a secret key. The server sends this JWT back to the client. The client stores this token in the
    browser's local storage.
  * **Tools:**  PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js, JSON Web Token, Visual Studio Code.
